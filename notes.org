* Tests
** One feature per file
** Look for problem cases in other latex documents
* Features
** Begin and end document on own line
** Environments should start and end on new lines

** Fold long lines to 80 characters
*** Care with trailing comments
*** No folding in verbatim environments, just warn
** Merge short alphanumeric lines
** Flags
*** -d Dry run
*** -p Print to STDOUT
*** -v Info verbose
*** -vv Debug verbose
** Log file
** Non-negativity and end-of-file checks apply per indenter type
*** Care with half-open intervals like [0,1)
*** Just use ignore comments for these cases
** Ignore some source lines
*** Line-by-line ignore
*** Block ignore
* Bugs
** Check multiple begins or ends on the same line
*** This should never happen once new lines are implemented
*** Still should implement counting for cumulative and back
** Better errors including line numbers in source file
** Check begins or ends with more brackets on the same line
* Structure
** Perform indenting
** While long lines are present
*** Trim long lines
