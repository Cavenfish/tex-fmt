#+title: tex-fmt
* Tasks
** Check other latex files
** Tidy code
** Documentation
** Try wrapping spaceless lines
* Features
** Aim for a single pass of wrapping and indenting
*** Three lists of strings
**** 1: lines of original file
**** 2: lines in processing queue
**** 3: lines of formatted file
*** Logic flow
**** If the queue is empty
***** Take a line from the original file and put it in the queue
**** Else
***** Indent the first line in the queue with the global indentation state
***** Keep the new indentation state in a temporary variable
***** If it then needs wrapping
****** Wrap it into several lines and push them all back onto the queue
***** Else
****** Move it from the queue to the output file
****** Update the global indentation state from the temporary variable
** Parsing with texlab
